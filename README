The perl modules R3, R3::rfcapi, R3::conn, R3::func and R3::itab
are free software; you may use, modify and redistribute them

To use the R3::* modules you will also need the RFCSDK, which is proprietary
software owned by SAP AG.

INTRODUCTION
============

R3::itab is an object interface for tables used as parameters in
RFC function calls. You need R3::rfcapi, R3::conn and R3::func to
use R3::itab.

REQUIREMENTS
============

The R3::* modules requires Perl 5, a C compiler and SAP's RFCSDK.
R3::conn requires R3::rfcapi.

INSTALLATION
============

You should install R3::rfcapi, R3::conn and R3::func before 
installing R3::itab.

If you used static linking of R3::rfcapi and created a new perl
with an other name, you must edit Makefile.PL an add 
'FULLPERL => "r3perl"' or whatever you called the perl executable.

Installing R3::rfcapi on Linux and other UNIX like systems:
	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install
You probably need to execute the last command as root.

On NT with VC++:
	D:\R3>perl Makefile.PL
	D:\R3>nmake
	D:\R3>nmake test
	D:\R3>nmake install

On other platforms:
Sorry, I do not know. Please tell me if you do.
